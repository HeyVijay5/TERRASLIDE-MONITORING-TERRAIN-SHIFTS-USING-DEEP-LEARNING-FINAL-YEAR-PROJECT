Landslides are among the most devastating and unpredictable natural disasters, posing significant threats to human lives, infrastructure, and ecological systems, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions. Accurate and early detection of landslide-prone zones plays a vital role in risk mitigation, emergency preparedness,  land-use planning. 
Landslides are among the most devastating and unpredictable natural disasters, posing significant threats to human lives, infrastructure, and ecological systems, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions. Accurate and early detection of landslide-prone zones plays a vital role in risk mitigation, emergency preparedness, and sustainable land-use planning. Traditional detection methods relying on geotechnical surveys and sensor networks are often labor-intensive, cost-prohibitive, and limited in spatial coverage. In contrast, advancements in computer vision and deep learning have paved the way for automated, scalable, and cost-effective solutions using satellite and terrain imagery.
Moreover, the integration of terrain-specific features such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), slope, and digital elevation models (DEMs) is considered as a future extension to enhance spatial awareness and improve segmentation accuracy in complex topographies. The use of custom loss functions like Dice Loss helped address class imbalance, a common challenge in segmentation tasks involving rare geospatial events like landslides. The models were evaluated not only on quantitative metrics but also through qualitative visualizations, including overlay comparisons of predicted masks against ground truth. This comprehensive evaluation framework ensures the reliability and reproducibility of the models in real-world deployments. The outcomes of this study have the potential to aid government agencies, urban planners, and disaster management teams in proactively identifying high-risk zones and implementing timely mitigation strategies.
This research explores the potential of deep learning-based semantic segmentation models in identifying landslide-affected areas. A comparative analysis is conducted across five state-of-the-art architectures—UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, DeepLabV3+, and SegFormer—using a curated geospatial dataset stored in HDF5 format. The models were trained and validated on normalized RGB satellite images paired with ground truth binary masks. Extensive preprocessing techniques, including min-max normalization and augmentation, were applied to enhance model generalization.
Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice Coefficient were employed to assess model performance comprehensively. The UNet model achieved the highest accuracy (0.9842), whereas UNet++ demonstrated the best balance between precision and recall, yielding the highest F1 Score (0.4607) and Dice Coefficient (0.4201). DeepLabV3+ and ResUNet performed reasonably well in recall but suffered from false positives, while SegFormer showed promising results despite requiring further fine-tuning.
Our findings emphasize that modern encoder-decoder and transformer-based models hold significant promise for geohazard mapping, particularly in landslide detection. This study not only demonstrates the applicability of deep learning in Earth observation tasks but also sets a foundation for building real-time landslide early warning systems integrated with geographic information systems (GIS).
